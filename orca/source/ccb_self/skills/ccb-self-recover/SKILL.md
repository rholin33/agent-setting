name: ccb-self-recover
description: Recover CCB agents, panes, mounts, provider contexts, API/provider failures, config reload aftermath, clear operations, and guarded single-agent restarts. Use when the user asks to fix, recover, restart if safe, clear context, reload, remount, or keep work going after provider/API failure.

# CCB Self Recover

Use this skill for runtime recovery after diagnosis. Mutations must go through
CCB control-plane commands. Raw tmux mutation and direct runtime-file writes are
forbidden.

## Recovery Gates

Before any mutation:

1. Confirm maintenance intent from the user, such as "fix", "recover",
   "restart if safe", "apply this config", or "make CCB healthy".
2. Read the current mounted daemon graph. The target must be a current
   daemon-graph agent for clear or restart-like actions.
3. Check busy/pending state:
   - `ccb ps`
   - `ccb queue --detail <agent|all>`
   - `ccb pend --inbox --detail <agent>`
   - `ccb trace <id>` when the issue involves active or pending lineage
4. Check `ccb fault list`. If active fault-injection rules affect the target,
   treat them as diagnostic evidence. Clear them with
   `ccb fault clear <rule_id|all>` only when the user intended maintenance and
   the rules are known test residue. If a rule is recent, or its task/reason
   fields could represent an active drill, ask before clearing unless the user
   explicitly asked to clear fault-injection rules.
   - "Recent" means created within the last 30 minutes by wall time. If no
     creation timestamp is available, treat the rule as recent.
   - Active-drill markers include task or reason text containing `test`,
     `drill`, `fault-inject`, `fault injection`, `chaos`, or `ci`.
   - Safe test residue is an old rule whose task/reason clearly matches a
     completed local test and no active queue/inbox/trace evidence depends on
     it.
5. Choose the least disruptive supported action.
6. Report exact commands, gates, affected agents, blockers, and what remains
   unchanged.

If the target is unknown, busy, has queued work, has pending reply delivery, or
has a pending chain continuation, stop and report blockers.

## Provider/API Or Startup-Input Recovery

For provider/API failures or changes that affect provider process, model, base
URL, environment, provider profile, command template, role assets, or startup
context, use this exact flow:

1. Gather evidence without reading secrets.
2. Distinguish per-dimension Provider authority from conversation state. Do not
   clear for an account/API/route change; preserve the stable CCB conversation
   and use validated resume, safe fork/import, or linked continuation.
3. Use built-in `ccb-config` to edit `.ccb/ccb.config` only when the fallback
   provider/model/base URL/profile/env-var reference is already configured or
   explicitly supplied by the user as a safe reference.
4. Run `ccb config validate`.
5. Complete `ccb config approve-commands` when an exact protected command value
   needs approval; never bypass the external receipt.
6. Run `ccb reload --dry-run`.
7. If validation and dry-run pass, and the user intended materialization, run
   `ccb reload`.
8. Re-check the current daemon graph and affected agent status.
9. Decide whether affected running agents still use stale provider process,
   environment, model, base URL, role asset, or context state.
10. If runtime refresh is still needed, restart only one affected current-graph
   agent at a time with `ccb restart <agent>`, and only when busy checks pass.
11. If `ccb restart <agent>` returns `blocked` or `failed`, report the blockers.
   Do not emulate restart with tmux commands. The remaining user-level options
   are to continue with unaffected agents or explicitly stop and restart the
   project with `ccb kill` then `ccb`; do not run project shutdown
   autonomously as a substitute for single-agent restart.

`ccb reload` is not the recovery finish line. It materializes config into the
daemon graph; running provider processes may still hold old startup inputs.

## Reload Aftermath

Use this section after `ccb-config` reports that validation and reload either
completed or are ready to materialize.

- Presentation-only changes, sidebar/tips display, labels, or other UI-only
  reloadable changes: re-check `ccb ps` and do not restart unless independent
  runtime evidence shows a stale or broken agent.
- Role asset, skill, prompt, tool, workspace, restore, permission, queue policy,
  watch-path, or startup-context changes: inspect the dry-run affected-agent
  list, re-check those current-graph agents, and restart only affected agents
  whose running provider state still reflects old startup assets or context.
- Provider command, provider profile, model, base URL, environment, API route,
  or command-template changes: after successful reload, expect affected running
  agents to need guarded `ccb restart <agent>` when busy checks pass.

Never restart an agent only because disk config changed. Restart decisions
must combine the reload plan, affected-agent list, current daemon graph, busy
checks, and provider/pane evidence.

## Supported Actions

- `ccb clear <agent>`: provider-native conversation/context clear. Run the
  pre-mutation checks in the Recovery Gates section first; use only when
  context clearing is the right fix and pending-work checks pass.
- `ccb reload --dry-run`: no-mutation config reload plan. Always safe in
  maintenance workflows.
- `ccb reload`: config materialization after `ccb config validate`,
  `ccb reload --dry-run`, supported plan, and explicit user materialization
  intent.
- `ccb restart <agent>`: one configured pane-backed current-graph agent after
  busy checks pass. The command itself must report `restart_status`, blockers,
  restartable agents, busy gate evidence, and old/new runtime evidence.
- `ccb roles update agentroles.ccb_self` or `ccb roles sync <path>`: role asset
  repair when the user is repairing `ccb_self` itself, there is no active
  maintenance operation that depends on the current role assets, and the target
  role/source version is clear.

## Handoffs

- Use `ccb-self-chain` first when trace evidence shows message/reply lineage is
  the primary problem. Restart is not the first repair for a broken job chain.
- Use built-in `ccb-config` for disk config edits and affected-agent reporting.
  After reload, this skill owns guarded runtime refresh decisions.
- Return the original business work to the original target agent unless the
  user explicitly retargets it.

## Red Lines

- Never restart all agents or unrelated agents.
- Never use `tmux kill-pane`, `kill-window`, `kill-server`, `respawn-pane`,
  `send-keys`, manual pane creation, or other raw tmux mutation.
- Never write lifecycle, lease, runtime, mailbox, provider session, or tmux
  authority files directly.
- Never read, print, store, search for, scrape, borrow, or use API keys or
  credentials.
- Never treat `.ccb/agents/*`, disk config, pid files, or tmux panes as live
  restart target authority.
