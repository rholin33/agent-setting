# CCB Self Validation Notes

Date: 2026-08-13

## Static Role Checks

- `agentroles.ccb_self` loads through the Agent Roles preview manifest loader.
- CCB adapter metadata declares `default_agent_name = "ccb_self"` and supports
  `codex` plus `claude`.
- The Role contains nine generic skills:
  `ccb-self-diagnose`, `ccb-self-recover`, `ccb-self-chain`,
  `ccb-comm-reply-recover`, `ccb-clear-resume`, `ccb-expert-reference`,
  `ccb-config`, `ccb-workflow-orchestrate`, and
  `ccb-mobile-relay-maintain`.
- The Role declares CCB expert references for source, GitHub, talk1 manuals,
  command/config, runtime flows, role/config system, release/test gates,
  recent CCB capabilities, Mobile/Relay runtime, and knowledge refresh, plus
  workflow orchestration pattern evidence.
- The Role memory includes symptom-to-skill routing for expert answers,
  config work, diagnosis, recovery, lineage repair, and user-visible reply
  stalls, context-clear task restoration, plus dynamic workflow orchestration.
- The full private `ccb-config` skill is source content for this Role only.
  Common inherited skill folders must not contain or install it for non-self
  agents.
- The `ccb-workflow-orchestrate` skill permits only bounded mounted-agent
  orchestration overlays after explicit activation intent, backup, validation,
  and CCB control-plane reload/restart gates. It must not write workflow
  instructions into Role source or mutate tmux directly.

## Runtime Contract Checks

The accepted draft was exercised from an isolated CCB source test project
before materialization:

- `ccb_test --diagnose`: confirmed source validation did not run from the CCB
  source checkout.
- `ccb_test config validate`: valid project config.
- `ccb_test reload --dry-run`: no-mutation reload plan.
- `ccb_test doctor logs codexer`: command syntax works.
- `ccb_test fault list` and `ccb_test fault clear all`: fault command syntax
  works without active rules.
- Draft `tools/doctor.py` with `CCB_BIN=ccb_test`: JSON `status: ok` with
  seven read-only evidence commands.

`ccb restart <agent>` is implemented in the CCB source CLI surface. The recover
skill treats it as the only guarded single-agent runtime replacement command,
and reports `blocked` or `failed` responses instead of simulating restart with
raw tmux mutation.

## V0.2 Expert Validation

After adding `ccb-expert-reference` and eleven role references:

- `python -m pytest -q tests/test_ccb_self_role.py`: `6 passed`.
- `python -m pytest -q`: `33 passed`.
- `python -m py_compile agent_roles/manifest.py tests/test_ccb_self_role.py
  roles/ccb-self/adapters/ccb/tools/doctor.py`: passed.
- Manifest load reported `agentroles.ccb_self 0.2.0` with `6` skills and `11`
  role references.
- `git diff --check`: passed.

## V0.3 Workflow Orchestration Validation

After adding `ccb-workflow-orchestrate`:

- `python -m pytest -q tests/test_ccb_self_role.py`: expected to pass with the
  new role version, skill count, reference inventory, and routing assertions.
- `python -m pytest -q`: expected to pass for the full repository suite.
- `git diff --check`: expected to pass.
- Static checks should confirm the new skill says:
  - manager-owned orchestration remains visible;
  - memory overlays are bounded mounted-agent runtime instructions, not Role
    source;
  - `ccb ask --chain` is used only when a result is required;
  - `ccb restart <agent>` is guarded, single-agent, and never raw tmux.

## V0.3.1 Clear-Resume Validation

After adding `ccb-clear-resume`:

- `python -m pytest -q tests/test_ccb_self_role.py`: `6 passed`.
- `python -m pytest -q`: `51 passed`.
- `git diff --check`: passed.
- Skill Creator `quick_validate.py roles/ccb-self/skills/ccb-clear-resume`:
  `Skill is valid!`.
- Static checks should confirm the new skill says:
  - build the resume packet before `ccb clear <agent>`;
  - use durable CCB trace, queue, reply, artifact, and runtime evidence;
  - resume through `ccb repair retry`, `ccb repair resubmit`, or fresh compact
    `ask`;
  - do not clear active work or duplicate active jobs.

## V0.4.0 CCB v8.6.2 Alignment

This revision must validate that:

- project tool-window commands and Provider command templates require
  `ccb config approve-commands` exact-value external receipts;
- safe/script mode and config validation do not bypass command approval;
- `ccb ask --chain`, exact active-turn `ccb followup`, and `ccb compact` use
  current released semantics;
- Provider authority is per-dimension and session continuity is preferred over
  context clear, including recovery from a corrupt current Codex session;
- Mobile/Relay maintenance separates server-wide host authority from project
  Pane evidence, protects invitation/credential/device secrets, and respects
  capability-negotiated Provider controls;
- native Windows/Herdr and visible Cursor Pane evidence do not inherit Unix
  tmux assumptions;
- all nine Role skills pass Skill Creator validation, the focused Role tests
  pass, and the full repository suite remains green.
