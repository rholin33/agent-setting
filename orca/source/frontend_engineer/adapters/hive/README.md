# Hive Adapter Notes

Hive may consume this Role through a Hive adapter.

The adapter should describe Hive's supported role surfaces, MCP behavior,
browser validation capability, tool-manifest behavior, and isolation model
without changing the core Role source format.

If a Hive adapter mounts this Role, project-specific instance naming, scope,
permissions, interaction topology, tool configuration, and prompt additions
belong in Project Binding, not Role source.

Generated Hive-native assets are projection output and must not be written
back into this Role source directory.

The `role-setup` skill is available as a generic lifecycle entrypoint, but Hive
support should be advertised only after a Hive adapter defines provider config,
provider-shared runtime, project binding, bridge projection records, repair,
and manager-side unmount semantics.
